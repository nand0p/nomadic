# Warship Skeleton

### Each application (warship) requires its own pipeline.
1. For each application, copy this skeleton diretory to a unique directory name.
2. Configure and execute terraform in this new directory.

Warship application pipeline will deploy as a CodePipeline, and upon pipeline execution, the application will deploy/update on the nomadic cluster.
